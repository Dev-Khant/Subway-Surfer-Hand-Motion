# EdgeTPU-optimized Vision Models

## Overview

This project includes computer vision models optimized for Edge TPU featured in
Pixel Phones, Coral Products, and more. These models improve the latency and
energy vs. accuracy pareto-frontier significantly compared to the existing
SOTA models when running on the Edge TPU devices.
